        <b style="color: #ffffff;">‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Neko is the co-owner and librarian of <i>Nya&Neko</i>, the local comic store. That <i>is</i> the name of the store, despite the huge sign on the front that says “MANGA.” 
          The astute among you will have noticed Neko doesn’t talk. He’s always been that way. Doesn’t bother him, though! He can get across anything he needs to with his chalkboard. He also communicates through sign language, but most people don’t know sign language. I bet if a customer started talking to him in sign language, he’d really like that. 
          Neko actually kickstarted his sister’s love for manga when he showed her the edition of Wyvern Sphere X he picked up at school. They were both hooked. Nowadays, Neko spends his days up on the second floor of the comic store, where he loves to take cat naps.
      Did you know “Neko” is just a stage name? No one knows his actual name. And no one ever will, probably. </b>
