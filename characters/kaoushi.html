        <b style="color: #00a010;">‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Kao Ushi grew up on a farm far away from Treelight. Under the watch of his older brother Ito, Kao quickly learned that the skills he has are not ones valued by his family. Instead of tending to the livestock, Kao was often found in the fields collecting flowers or playing pretend. Since his death at age 18, he has trained hard to become a guardian angel – a job where his skills will be fully appreciated. After years of training, Kao was assigned his first placement: Alfred Brown, a man who lost his son. </b>
