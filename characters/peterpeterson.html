        <b style="color: #ff3810;">‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Peter Peterson is your average teenage delinquent. (Technically, he performed better than Shai or Yello did in school, but don’t tell him we told you that.) He enjoys graffiti art, video games, and is quite good at playing the drums. 
          In 2019, he was kicked out of his home for coming out to his parents as a trans man. For a while, Peter was homeless. He took up residence behind Breadley’s for some months, joining Soup and soaking up as much as he could of their street smarts. 
          Soon before the events of Chapter 1, Peter was taken in by a mysterious guy named Dominic. He has since started a small business selling t-shirts with original designs at his store KING O’ CHAIN. Peter is quick to act on his impulses, only thinking about his actions after the fact. He also has quite the colorful vocabulary. </b>
