      <b style="color: #ffffff;">‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎The personification of an old, leather bound book. The smell of musk and oak fill the room when he walks in, and he always looks like he has a secret.
    <br>
    ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Melodious was once a renowned physicist and professor. At a young age he became obsessed with proving the existence of higher dimensional beings, specifically Zigzag and the “Ghoulies”. In secret, he garnered as much evidence as he could to convince the world of their presence.
    <br>
    ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎After unveiling his ideas about the Ghoulies and the dimension they live in, his hypotheses were seen as scientifically blasphemous and he had his doctorate revoked.
    After having his lifelong career and status stripped away in an instant, he decided to live off the grid; He retired to his lavish home filled with books and wine.
    <br>
    ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎In his isolation and spite, he crafted a persona: Dr. Hypnosis.
    When in their lab coat attire, they manically continue their work in a lab hidden behind a bookshelf.
    <br>
    ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎They have setup cameras and drones all around Los Angeles, California, and the surrounding areas. Dr. Hypnosis views the city as a spiritual epicenter of paranormal activity, theorizing that if the Ghoulies were to arrive anywhere, it’d be there.
    <br>
    ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎They patiently wait for their arrival…
