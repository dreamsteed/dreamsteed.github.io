      <b style="color: #ffffff;">‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ZigZag is a 5th dimensional being of mystic origin. With his legion of “Ghoulies,” he grows his power and influence by manipulating one’s perception of time and reality. Set on worldwide assimilation, he is bound only by his own manifestations.
    <br>
    <br>
    ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ZigZag offers souls passing a chance to live eternally if they devote servitude to him and join his collective consciousness. If one agrees, they become one of his many Ghoulies. Other ways he can enlist individuals is by entering their dreams or enticing one’s deepest desires in exchange for devotion.
<br>
<br>
‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Despite their joyous and goofy demeanor, it is a complete facade. To perceive time all at once felt like a curse when coming into existence. Through dark magic he has altered his own view of time slightly, becoming unaware of future events, but the past is still ever present. He envies humans for their blissful and linear perception of time. 
Their final ambition is to take complete dominion over earth to gain higher knowledge of the universe through hyper cosmic awareness.
