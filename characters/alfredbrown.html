        <b style="color: #e08040;">‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Alfred Brown is the <s>malewife</s> husband of Yuki Chairo and father of Shai Brown and the late Shia Brown. He lives in Treelight, where he has supported his family working as a teacher of religion at Treelight Middle School for over 15 years. In his free time, Alfred can be found sipping coffee at Oliver’s, spending time with his wife, or in his garage, working out. Since the death of his son, Alfred has experienced a marked change in his demeanor: he keeps a journal describing his every dream, often paces back and forth, lost in thought, and his smoking addiction has only worsened. The hallucinations and compulsions he has experienced his whole life have gotten worse, too. Plagued with thoughts about his rocky relationship with his daughter and the tragic death of his son, Alfred is irritable, erratic, and moody.</b>
