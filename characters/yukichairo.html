      <b style="color: #4080c0;">‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Yuki Chairo is the wife of Alfred Brown and mother of Shai Brown and the late Shia Brown, and lives with them in Treelight. Yuki has a degree in English, which she puts to work in her career as a freelance novelist. When she’s not typing away at her laptop, she enjoys doing yoga, reading poetry, and spending time with her <s>malewife</s> husband Alfred. Since the death of her son, Yuki has been absorbed by her work, using it as a means to escape her reality. She has benefited greatly since the arrival of Kao, who reminds her to take breaks from her work and teaches her what he knows about gardening. Yuki relies on coffee a bit more than Alfred does. Which is saying a lot.</b>
