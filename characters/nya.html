        <b style="color: #b0ffb0;"> ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎Nya is the co-owner and cashier of <i>Nya&Neko</i>, the local comic store. That <i>is</i> the name of the store, despite the huge sign on the front that says “MANGA.” 
          The twins moved into Treelight a couple years ago after seeing the building for rent, knowing immediately that this was their shot at their lifelong dream of owning a manga store. This was big news for Treelight – the small town that it is, everyone knows each other and newcomers are a rarity. Nya made short work of getting to know her customers. All six of them. The relaxed nature of their shop suits Nya well: she’s free to do whatever the hell she wants. Which is often pulling pranks on customers, but NEVER on Neko. She would probably get along pretty well with Soup, the town’s other notable trickster, but the two have never met.
      Did you know “Nya” is just a stage name? No one knows her actual name. And no one ever will, probably.</b>
